# Local Development with faynoSync — Choose Your Path 🛠️

Getting started with faynoSync development? Great! You have two main options for setting up your local environment. Whether you prefer a traditional local setup or the convenience of Docker, we've got you covered.

---

## Option 1: Traditional Local Development 🖥️

Perfect for developers who want full control over their environment and need to make frequent code changes.

### What You'll Need:

- **MongoDB** 🗄️
  - Stores all your application data, versions, and metadata
  - [Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)

- **Golang** 🐹
  - The heart of faynoSync
  - [Installation Guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)

- **MinIO** 📦
  - Your local S3-compatible storage
  - [Installation Guide](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/deploy-minio-single-node-single-drive.html)

### Setting Up:

1. Install all required services
2. Create your `.env` file with necessary configurations
3. Run faynoSync:
   ```bash
   # First run (with migrations)
   go run faynoSync.go --migration
   
   # Subsequent runs
   go run faynoSync.go
   ```

### Benefits:
- ⚡ Fast development cycle
- 🔧 Direct access to all components
- 🧪 Easy debugging
- 🔄 Quick code changes

### Testing Your Setup:
Want to make sure everything is working correctly? Just run:
```bash
go test
```
This will verify that all components are properly configured and your local environment is ready for development.

---

## Option 2: Docker Development 🐳

Ideal for quick setup and testing, or when you want to avoid installing dependencies locally.

### What You'll Need:

- **Docker** 🐳
  - [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- **Docker Compose** 🎵
  - [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Two Ways to Use Docker:

#### 1. Full Container Setup
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Perfect for:
- 🚀 Quick testing
- 🧪 Initial setup
- 🔄 Testing API functionality

#### 2. Hybrid Approach
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.development.yaml up
```
This starts only the dependencies (MongoDB and MinIO) while you run faynoSync locally.

### Benefits:
- 🚀 Quick setup
- 🧩 Isolated environment
- 🔄 Consistent across machines
- 🧪 Easy testing

### Testing Your Setup:
After running `docker compose up --build`, wait until the s3-service successfully creates the bucket, then run:
```bash
docker exec -it faynoSync_backend "/usr/bin/faynoSync_tests"
```
This will run the test suite inside the container to verify everything is working correctly.

---

## Environment Configuration ⚙️

Both approaches need proper environment configuration. Here are the key variables you'll need:

```bash
# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_DRIVER=minio
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://root:password@127.0.0.1/faynosync_db

# API Configuration
API_URL=http://localhost:9000
PORT=9000
```

For a complete list of environment variables, check out our [Environment Configuration Guide](https://ku9nov.github.io/faynoSync-site/docs/getting-started/env-overview).

## Which Option Should You Choose? 🤔

### Choose Local Development if you:
- 🔧 Need to modify the code frequently
- 🐛 Want to debug easily
- ⚡ Need fast development cycles
- 💻 Prefer direct control over your environment

### Choose Docker if you:
- 🚀 Want quick setup
- 🧪 Need to test the API
- 💻 Work on multiple machines
- 🧩 Prefer isolated environments
