# Performance Mode — Speed Up Your API ⚡

Is your faynoSync instance handling thousands of update checks per minute? Worried about database load? Meet Performance Mode — your API's new best friend for handling high traffic efficiently!

---

## What is Performance Mode? 🤔

Performance Mode is a smart caching system that:
- 🚀 Reduces response times
- 📉 Lowers database load
- 💾 Optimizes resource usage

It works by caching frequently requested data in Redis, making your API responses lightning-fast!

---

## How It Works 🛠️

### The Magic Behind the Scenes
1. **Request Arrives** 📥
   - API checks if Performance Mode is enabled (`PERFORMANCE_MODE=true`)
   - Looks for cached data in Redis

2. **Cache Check** 🔍
   - If data exists in cache → returns it immediately
   - If not → queries the database

3. **Cache Update** 💾
   - New data is stored in Redis
   - Ready for next request

### What Gets Cached?
Currently, Performance Mode is implemented for the `checkVersion` endpoint, which is one of the most frequently called endpoints in the system.

---

## Why Do We Need It? 🎯

### 1. Database Load Reduction
- 📊 Fewer queries to MongoDB
- 💪 Less strain on your database
- 🎯 Better resource utilization

### 2. Faster Response Times
- ⚡ Cached responses are returned instantly
- 🏎️ No need to wait for database queries
- 🎮 Perfect for high-traffic scenarios

### 3. Resource Optimization
- 🌱 Lower CPU usage
- 💧 Reduced memory consumption
- 📈 Better scalability

---

## How to Enable It? 🔌

Just add this to your `.env` file:
```bash
PERFORMANCE_MODE=true
```

That's it! Your API will automatically start using Redis for caching.

---

## Testing Performance 🧪

Want to see the difference? Try this test script:

```bash
start_time=$(date +%s); 
for i in {1..1000}; do 
  response=$(curl -s -w "Connect Time: %{time_connect}s, Start Transfer Time: %{time_starttransfer}s, Total Time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/stdout --location 'http://localhost:9000/checkVersion?app_name=myapp&version=0.0.3&channel=nightly&platform=null&arch=null'); 
  echo "$response"; 
done; 
end_time=$(date +%s); 
total_time=$((end_time - start_time)); 
echo "Total execution time: $total_time seconds"
```

Compare the results with and without Performance Mode enabled!

## Important Notes 📝

1. **Cache Invalidation** 🔄
   - Cache is automatically cleared when you publish a new version
   - New data is cached on the next request
   - Ensures users always get the latest information

2. **Current Implementation** 🎯
   - Only implemented for `checkVersion` endpoint
   - Perfect for high-frequency update checks
   - More endpoints might be added in the future

3. **When to Use** ⚡
   - High-traffic environments
   - Systems with frequent update checks
   - Scenarios where response time is critical

---

## Best Practices 💡

1. **Enable in Production** 🚀
   - Always use Performance Mode in production
   - Especially if you expect high traffic

2. **Monitor Performance** 📊
   - Keep an eye on response times
   - Watch Redis memory usage
   - Track database load

3. **Regular Updates** 🔄
   - Cache is automatically managed
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Just focus on your app!
