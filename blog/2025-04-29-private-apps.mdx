# Private Apps in faynoSync — Keep Your Software Secure 🔒

When developing software, sometimes you need to keep things private. Whether it's internal tools, beta versions, or enterprise applications — not everything should be publicly accessible. That's why faynoSync comes with built-in support for private applications.

## What are Private Apps? 🤔

Private apps in faynoSync are applications that are stored in a separate, private S3 bucket. This gives you an extra layer of security and control over who can access your software.

Once an app is marked as private, it stays private forever — this is a one-way decision to ensure consistency and security.

## How to Create a Private App? 🛠️

There are two ways to create a private app:

### 1. Using the Web Dashboard 🖥️

Simply check the "Private" option when creating your app through the dashboard interface. It's that simple!

### 2. Using the API 📡

When making a POST request to `/app/create`, include the `private` parameter:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/app/create' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>' \
--form 'data="{\"app\":\"appName\", \"private\": true}"'
```

## How Private Apps Work? 🔐

1. **Storage**: Private apps are stored in a separate S3 bucket (defined by `S3_BUCKET_NAME` in your environment)
2. **Access Control**: You can control who can download your private apps through the `ENABLE_PRIVATE_APP_DOWNLOADING` setting:
   - If `true`: Anyone can download the app using the public API endpoints
   - If `false`: Only authenticated users can download the app

## Security Features 🛡️

Think of private apps in faynoSync as your software's VIP section! Here's what makes them special:

- 🔒 **Separate Storage**: Your private apps live in their own secure S3 bucket, like having a private vault for your most valuable assets
- 🔐 **One-Way Privacy**: Once you mark an app as private, it stays private forever. This might sound strict, but it's actually a good thing — it ensures your security settings can't be accidentally changed
- 👥 **Smart Access Control**: You're in charge! You can decide whether your private apps need authentication to download, giving you perfect control over who gets access
- 🚫 **Download Protection**: Want to make sure only your team can download the app? Just set `ENABLE_PRIVATE_APP_DOWNLOADING=false`, and only authenticated users will be able to access it

---

## Best Practices 💡

1. Use private apps for:
   - Internal tools and utilities
   - Beta versions of your software
   - Enterprise-specific applications
   - Software requiring license validation

2. Set `ENABLE_PRIVATE_APP_DOWNLOADING=false` when you need strict access control

3. Always use authentication tokens when accessing private apps in restricted mode
