# Team-Based Authorization in faynoSync — Manage Your Team Like a Pro 👥

Managing a team of developers? Need to control who can do what in your faynoSync instance? Starting from version **1.4.0**, faynoSync introduces a powerful **Team Based Authorization Matrix** that gives you complete control over your team's access and permissions.

---

## What is Team-Based Authorization? 🤔

Think of it as your team's digital headquarters! The Team Based Authorization Matrix is a sophisticated system that lets you:

- 👨‍💼 Create and manage team users
- 🔐 Assign specific permissions
- 🏢 Keep data isolated between different teams
- 📊 Track who can do what

## Meet the Players 🎭

### The Administrator 👑
- You're the boss! Each admin is unique
- You own your team of users
- You can create, update, and delete your team members
- You have full control over passwords and permissions
- You can only access your own team's resources

### The Team User 👤
- A unique member of your team
- Belongs only to you (their admin)
- Can't manage other users
- Can only work with resources you've allowed
- Everything they create belongs to you

---

## What Can Your Team Do? 🛠️

Each team member can have different permissions for different types of resources:

### Resource Types:
- 📱 Applications
- 📊 Channels
- 💻 Platforms
- 🏗️ Architectures

### Available Permissions:
- ➕ Create
- ✏️ Edit
- 🗑️ Delete
- ⬆️ Upload (for apps)
- ⬇️ Download (for apps)

---

## Smart Resource Management 🧠

- 🔒 Team users can only see and use resources they've been given access to
- 🏢 Each admin's resources are completely separate
- 👀 You (as admin) can see everything your team creates
- 📝 Different teams can have resources with the same names

## How to Manage Your Team? 🎯

### Option 1: Using the API

#### Creating a Team User
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/user/create' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "username": "teamuser1",
    "password": "password123",
    "permissions": {
      "apps": {
        "create": true,
        "delete": false,
        "edit": true,
        "download": true,
        "upload": false
      }
      // ... other permissions
    }
  }'
```

#### Updating Permissions
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/user/update' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "username": "teamuser1",
    "password": "newpassword123",
    "permissions": {
      // ... updated permissions
    }
  }'
```

### Option 2: Using the Web Dashboard 🖥️

   - ✅ Assign permissions with simple checkboxes

#### For Team Users:
1. Go to your **Profile** section
2. View your current permissions at a glance:
   - 📱 Which applications you can access
   - 📊 What actions you can perform
   - 🔒 What resources are available to you

This visual interface makes it much easier to:
- 🎯 Understand your permissions
