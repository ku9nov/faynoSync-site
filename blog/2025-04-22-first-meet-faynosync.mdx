# faynoSync — the simple open-source update server you've been waiting for

In today's fast-paced world of AI and digitalization, more and more people, companies, and startups are creating their own applications. Depending on the type of app, you might publish it on platforms like Google Play, the App Store, and so on. These services not only handle publishing but also provide automatic versioned updates to end users.

But there's a small catch.

Bureaucracy. Registrations. The 9 circles of hell you have to go through before your app finally goes live on those platforms.  
Just think — where do you actually download apps like **Discord**, **Brave Browser**, or **Docker Desktop**?  
Exactly. The list goes on.

That's where **faynoSync** comes in.
