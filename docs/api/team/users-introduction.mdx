# Users Management

The Team Based Authorization Matrix is a permission system, designed to support multi-team collaboration while ensuring strict access boundaries between users and resources. It enables administrators to create isolated teams of users, assign granular permissions per resource type, and maintain full control over data ownership and visibility.

This model ensures:

- Clear separation between administrators and their team users.

- Scoped access to applications, channels, platforms, and architectures.

- Automatic ownership and permission tracking.

- Full traceability of all actions performed by team users.

The following API endpoints allow administrators to manage team users and control their access within the boundaries of their own account.
