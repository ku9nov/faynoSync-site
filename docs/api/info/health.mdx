# Health Check

Check the health status of the **FaynoSync** service.

The Health Check API allows you to verify the operational status of the FaynoSync application. This is useful for monitoring and ensuring that your service is running as expected.

## Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9000/health
```

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Health status of the application (always "healthy" when functioning correctly) |

## Usage

You can use this endpoint in your monitoring tools or health checks to ensure that the **FaynoSync** application is running smoothly. If the application is functioning correctly, the response will always return a status of "healthy".

If you encounter issues or receive a different status, further investigation may be necessary to identify and resolve any problems.

## Notes

- This endpoint does not require authentication
- The response is immediate and lightweight
- Use this for load balancer health checks and monitoring systems
- A non-200 response indicates the service is not healthy
