# Health Check

Check the health status of the **FaynoSync** service.

The Health Check API allows you to verify the operational status of the FaynoSync application. This is useful for monitoring and ensuring that your service is running as expected.

**Request:**

To check the health status of the application, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9000/health
```

**Response:**

A successful request will return a JSON response indicating the health status of the application:

```json
{
    "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Usage

You can use this endpoint in your monitoring tools or health checks to ensure that the **FaynoSync** application is running smoothly. If the application is functioning correctly, the response will always return a status of "healthy".

If you encounter issues or receive a different status, further investigation may be necessary to identify and resolve any problems.
