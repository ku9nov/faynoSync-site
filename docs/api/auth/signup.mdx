| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

| `username` | string | ✅ | The username for your account |
| `password` | string | ✅ | The password for the new account |
| `api_key` | string | ✅ | API key required for signing up (check this value in `.env` file) |

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password", "api_key": "UHp3aKb40fwpoKZluZByWQ"}' \
http://localhost:9000/signup
```

}
```

### Response Fields

## Notes

- The `api_key` must match the value configured in your server's `.env` file
- Usernames must be unique within the system
- Passwords should follow security best practices (minimum length, complexity, etc.)
- After successful registration, use the `/login` endpoint to obtain a JWT token
- The user created typically receives administrative privileges
