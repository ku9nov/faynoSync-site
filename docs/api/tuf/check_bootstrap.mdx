# Check Bootstrap

Check whether bootstrap has already been performed for a specific application and whether it completed successfully.

Use this endpoint before starting a new bootstrap to determine if the TUF repository for the given app is already initialized. If bootstrap has not been done yet, the system is available for bootstrap; if it has completed, you will receive the existing bootstrap identifier and lock information.

## Endpoint

```
GET /tuf/v1/bootstrap?appName=<app_name>
```

## Headers

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <token>` |

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `appName` | string | ✅ | Name of the application to check bootstrap status for |

## Example Request

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/tuf/v1/bootstrap?appName=<app_name>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>'
```

## Response

### Bootstrap Not Yet Performed (200 OK)

When bootstrap has not been done for this application, the system is available for bootstrap:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "bootstrap": false,
    "id": "",
    "redis_locks": {
      "bootstrap_lock": "",
      "pre_locks": []
    },
    "state": null
  },
  "message": "System available for bootstrap."
}
```

### Bootstrap Already Completed (200 OK)

When bootstrap has already completed successfully for this admin and application:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "bootstrap": true,
    "id": "8085748f-a572-491b-b1b0-d047daa3ae05",
    "redis_locks": {
      "bootstrap_lock": "8085748f-a572-491b-b1b0-d047daa3ae05",
      "pre_locks": []
    },
    "state": null
  },
  "message": "Bootstrap already completed for this admin."
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `data.bootstrap` | boolean | `true` if bootstrap has been completed for this app; `false` if not yet performed |
| `data.id` | string | Bootstrap session identifier; empty when bootstrap has not been done, UUID when completed |
| `data.redis_locks.bootstrap_lock` | string | Redis lock value for bootstrap; empty or matches `id` when bootstrap is in use or completed |
| `data.redis_locks.pre_locks` | array | List of pre-lock identifiers (if any) |
| `data.state` | object \| null | Optional state payload; may be `null` |
| `message` | string | Human-readable status: "System available for bootstrap." or "Bootstrap already completed for this admin." |

## Notes

- Requires a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header (admin user).
- Call this endpoint before starting bootstrap to avoid duplicate initialization.
- When `bootstrap` is `false`, you can proceed with the [Start Bootstrap](/docs/api/tuf/start_bootstrap) flow.
- When `bootstrap` is `true`, the TUF repository for this app is already set up; no need to run bootstrap again for this admin.
