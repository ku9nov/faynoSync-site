# TUF Integration

## Important Notice

:::danger Danger Zone

**This documentation is NOT:**
- Official TUF framework documentation
- Official faynoSync API documentation

**This documentation IS:**
- A description of the process and implementation regarding the integration of the TUF framework into the faynoSync API
- A developer's perspective on how TUF integration was approached and implemented

**Critical Warnings:**

1. This documentation does not position itself as documentation for TUF, or for the integration of TUF into a real API.

2. These documents may contain incorrect implementations and critical errors.

3. **This documentation does not reflect the current state of the codebase.** It may not even be committed, and it is definitely not released. This is not the final implementation and may not reflect actual functionality.

4. This documentation has **not been verified by TUF developers** and we cannot be certain that everything is implemented and understood correctly at this time.

:::

## Overview

This section documents the integration of TUF (The Update Framework) into the faynoSync API. It describes the implementation process, architectural decisions, and the approach taken to integrate TUF functionality.

## Development Approach

Initially, we attempted to implement TUF integration primitively, based on examples and surface-level information found on the internet. However, we were not satisfied with the result and the implementation quality.

As a result, a decision was made to:
- Deeply understand how the TUF framework works
- Implement it more correctly based on existing API services built around TUF
- Study real-world implementations and best practices

Those interested in how TUF works may find this documentation useful, but please keep in mind the warnings above.

## Documentation Structure

This section contains:

- **[Bootstrap Key Generation](./generate/generation)** - Details about generating TUF bootstrap keys and initializing the repository
- **[Bootstrap Process](./bootstrap/bootstrap)** - Information about the bootstrap initialization process, status checking, and management

## Current Status

:::warning Work in Progress

The implementation described in these documents is currently under development and may not reflect the final production state. Use this information as a reference for understanding the approach, but verify against the actual codebase before making any decisions.
