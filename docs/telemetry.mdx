# Telemetry System

The telemetry system in FaynoSync provides detailed analytics and insights about your application's usage, helping you understand your user base and make informed decisions about updates and maintenance.

You can enable statistics by defining the variable `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true` in the `.env` file.

## Overview

The telemetry system collects and aggregates data about your application's usage, including:
- Total requests
- Unique clients
- Version distribution
- Platform usage
- Architecture distribution
- Channel usage
- Daily statistics

## Dashboard Visualization and Analysis

The telemetry dashboard provides powerful visualization and analysis tools that help you gain valuable insights into your user base:

### Client Analytics
- Accurate client counting using the `X-Device-ID` header to prevent duplicate counting
- Real-time tracking of active users across different platforms
- Historical trends showing user growth and engagement

### Version Distribution Analysis
- Detailed breakdown of application versions in use
- Version adoption rates across different platforms
- Identification of outdated versions requiring attention

### Platform and Architecture Insights
- Platform popularity metrics to understand user preferences
- Architecture distribution to optimize resource allocation
- Cross-platform version update rates to identify platform-specific issues

### Business Intelligence
- Data-driven decision making for product development
- Identification of high-priority platforms and architectures
- Understanding of user behavior and preferences
- Strategic insights for business growth and product optimization

## How It Works

### Data Collection

Telemetry data is collected automatically when clients check for updates using the `/checkVersion` API endpoint. The system tracks:

- Device ID (via `X-Device-ID` header)
- Application name
- Platform
- Channel
- Architecture
- Application version

### Data Storage

All telemetry data is stored in Redis with a 30-day retention period. The data is organized by:
- Administrator
- Application
- Date
- Various metrics (versions, platforms, channels, etc.)

## Access Control

### Administrator Access

Each administrator has access to telemetry data only for their own resources. This ensures data privacy and proper separation of concerns.

### Team User Access

Team users have access to their administrator's telemetry data, but with some limitations:
- They can view all statistics
- They can only filter/sort data for resources they have access to
- Access is verified through the API to ensure proper authorization

## Device ID Requirements

### Importance of Device ID

The `X-Device-ID` header is crucial for accurate telemetry data. It helps:
- Track unique devices
- Provide accurate user counts
- Generate meaningful statistics

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Generate a unique device ID for each installation
2. Store the ID persistently on the device
3. Include it in all requests to the `/checkVersion` endpoint
4. Use the same ID across app restarts

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: The `X-Device-ID` header should:
- NOT contain any personal information
- NOT include IP addresses
- NOT include any sensitive data
- Be used solely for device identification

## API Usage

### Collecting Telemetry

Telemetry is automatically collected when using the `/checkVersion` endpoint. Ensure you include the `X-Device-ID` header:

```http
GET /checkVersion?app_name=myapp&version=1.0.0&channel=stable&platform=darwin&arch=x64
X-Device-ID: unique-device-identifier
```

### Viewing Telemetry Data

Access telemetry data through the dashboard or API:

```http
GET /telemetry?range=week
```

Available query parameters:
- `date`: Specific date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `range`: Time range ("week" or "month")
- `apps`: Filter by specific apps
- `channels`: Filter by channels
- `platforms`: Filter by platforms
- `architectures`: Filter by architectures

## Best Practices

1. **Device ID Generation**
   - Use UUID v4 or similar for device IDs
   - Store IDs in secure, persistent storage
   - Never change the ID for an existing installation

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Never include personal information in device IDs
   - Follow data protection regulations
   - Regularly review collected data

3. **Implementation**
   - Implement telemetry collection early in development
   - Test with various device configurations
   - Monitor data quality and accuracy

## Limitations

1. Data is retained for 30 days
2. Statistics are only collected when `X-Device-ID` is provided
3. Team users have limited filtering capabilities
4. Data is aggregated daily
