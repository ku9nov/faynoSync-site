# Team Based Authorization Matrix

:::tip
Available since version 1.4.0
:::

Starting from version **1.4.0**, faynoSync API includes a **Team Based Authorization Matrix** — a system that enables fine-grained, team-level access control. This mechanism allows administrators to create team users, assign specific permissions, and strictly isolate data between different administrators.

## Core Concepts

### Administrator

- A unique user (admin usernames must be unique).

- Owns a private set of team users.

- Has access **only to their own users and resources**.

- Can create, update, and delete their own team users.

- Can set a password (including auto-generation via UI), change the username, password, and permissions of a user — **only if that user belongs to them**.

### Team User

- Also a unique user (usernames must not be duplicated).

- Belongs to a specific administrator and is **isolated** from others.

- **Has no access** to any user-related API (user management endpoints).

- Can only create, edit, or delete **resources that belong to their administrator**.

- Any resource created by a team user is automatically owned by their administrator.

### Access Permissions

Each team user can be granted specific permissions, defined separately for each type of resource.

#### Supported Permissions:

- Create

- Edit

- Delete

- Upload (only for `applications`)

- Download (only for `applications`)

#### Resource Types:

- Applications

- Channels

- Platforms

- Architectures

When a resource is created by a team user who has the Create permission for that resource type, it will be **automatically added to the team user's list of allowed resources**.

### Resource Visibility and Ownership

- Team users can **only access resources they’ve been explicitly granted access to**.

- Team users cannot see or manage resources from other administrators.

- **Administrators can view and manage all resources created by their team users**.

- Duplicate resource names (`applications`, `channels`, `platforms`, `architectures`) **are allowed across administrators**, but not within the same administrator's scope.

### API Changes

To prevent collisions from duplicated resource names across different administrators, the following endpoints now require an additional mandatory query parameter: `owner`.

#### Updated Endpoints:

- `GET /checkVersion`

- `GET /apps/latest`

`owner` is the administrator's account name. It ensures that the correct scope is used when resolving resource names.

### Expected Behavior

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Team User</th>
      <th>Administrator</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Create resources</td>
      <td>✅ (within admin scope)</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edit resources</td>
      <td>✅ (only own admin’s)</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delete resources</td>
      <td>✅ (only own admin’s)</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Manage users</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Access user API</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Access other admins' data</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>❌</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
