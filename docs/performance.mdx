# Performance Mode

Performance Mode is an important feature that optimizes the performance of our API by reducing latency on frequently repeated requests. This mode uses Redis to cache the results of requests, allowing us to store responses for commonly used queries and avoid redundant database calls.

## Why Is This Needed

Enabling Performance Mode allows us to:

* Reduce database load: Using the cache helps avoid unnecessary queries to MongoDB.

* Increase API response speed: Cached responses are returned significantly faster than executing queries against the database.

* Optimize resource usage: Lowering the number of database queries can also reduce resource consumption and improve overall system performance.

## How Performance Mode Works

* **Environment Variable Check:** Performance Mode is enabled if the `.env` file defines the variable `PERFORMANCE_MODE=true`.

* **Response Caching:** When a request hits the API, it first checks Redis for cached data for that request. If data is found, it is returned to the client.

* **Executing the Request:** If no cached data is found, a query is executed against the database. The result is stored in Redis for future use.

## Expected Behavior

**Performance Mode Enabled:**

- API requests check Redis for cached responses.
- If cache exists, a quick response is returned from the cache.
- If no cache exists, data is fetched from the database and cached for later use.

**Performance Mode Disabled:**

- The API always executes queries against the database without checking the cache. This may lead to increased response times, especially for frequently repeated requests.

## Advanced Performance Optimization with Nginx

For even better performance, you can configure Nginx to provide additional caching layer for the `/checkVersion` endpoint. This is particularly useful because this endpoint performs database checks for channels, platforms, and architectures, which can create additional load.

### Nginx Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `nginx.conf`:

```nginx
# Add this to your global 'http' block in nginx.conf
# Enables caching for the /checkVersion endpoint
proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=checkversion_cache:10m inactive=60s max_size=100m;

# Optional: enable rate limiting (used in /checkVersion block below)
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=req_limit:10m rate=10r/s;
```

And in your `server` block:

```nginx
# Optimized location for version check with caching
location = /checkVersion {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;

    # Enable microcaching for 60 seconds
    proxy_cache checkversion_cache;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 60s;
    proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";

    # Use stale cache if backend is slow or returns error
    proxy_cache_use_stale error timeout updating http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;

    # Lock to prevent multiple upstream requests for the same key
    proxy_cache_lock               on;
    proxy_cache_lock_timeout      65s;
    proxy_cache_background_update on;

    # Add custom header to inspect cache hits/misses
    add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;

    # Optional: enable rate limiting to prevent abuse
    # Uncomment if needed
    # limit_req zone=req_limit burst=20 nodelay;

    # Standard proxy headers
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Timeouts
    proxy_connect_timeout 60;
    proxy_send_timeout    60;
    proxy_read_timeout    60;
    send_timeout          60;
}
```

### Benefits of Nginx Caching

* **Reduced Database Load:** Nginx cache prevents requests from reaching the backend for frequently accessed data
* **Faster Response Times:** Cached responses are served directly by Nginx without backend processing
* **Better Resource Utilization:** Reduces the number of database queries for channel, platform, and architecture validation
* **Graceful Degradation:** Uses stale cache if the backend is slow or returns errors

### Cache Monitoring

You can monitor cache performance by checking the `X-Cache-Status` header in responses:
- `HIT`: Response served from Nginx cache
- `MISS`: Response fetched from backend
- `UPDATING`: Cache is being updated in background
- `STALE`: Stale cache used due to backend issues

## Checking Performance
You can test the performance of the API using the following command:

```bash
start_time=$(date +%s); 
for i in {1..1000}; do 
  response=$(curl -s -w "Connect Time: %{time_connect}s, Start Transfer Time: %{time_starttransfer}s, Total Time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/stdout --location 'http://localhost:9000/checkVersion?app_name=myapp&version=0.0.3&channel=nightly&platform=null&arch=null'); 
  echo "$response"; 
done; 
end_time=$(date +%s); 
total_time=$((end_time - start_time)); 
echo "Total execution time: $total_time seconds"
```

:::tip
Note on Functionality
The Performance Mode is currently implemented only for the `checkVersion` request.
In the case of uploading a new application with `publish` set to `true`, the Redis keys for that application will be removed, and it will be cached the next time the `checkVersion` request is made.
:::

## Conclusion

Performance Mode is a vital tool for enhancing the speed and efficiency of our API. By caching the results of requests, we can reduce database load and provide faster data access for our users. It is recommended to activate Performance Mode in environments expecting high API load.

For maximum performance, consider implementing both Redis caching (Performance Mode) and Nginx caching for a multi-layer caching strategy that provides optimal response times and resource utilization.
