# Local development

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the FaynoSync repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ku9nov/faynoSync.git
cd faynoSync
```

## Prerequisites

To get started with developing FaynoSync locally, you will need to set up the following services:

**MongoDB** - A NoSQL database used to store application data, including version information, channel settings, and metadata. MongoDB’s flexible document structure is perfect for handling the dynamic data models required by FaynoSync.



**Golang** - The main programming language used to build FaynoSync. Golang’s performance, simplicity, and strong concurrency support make it an ideal choice for developing efficient, scalable backend services.



**MinIO** - An object storage service compatible with the Amazon S3 API. MinIO is used in FaynoSync to simulate S3 storage locally, allowing you to upload and manage application files directly on your machine during development. It provides the same API as AWS S3, making it easy to switch between local and production environments.



## Setting Up Your Local Environment

### Install MongoDB
MongoDB is used to store all necessary data for FaynoSync, including application metadata, version control, channel, platform and architecture information. Ensure MongoDB is up and running on your local machine before starting the API.

**Installation Guide**: [MongoDB Installation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Install Golang
The FaynoSync API is built with Golang, so you need to have it installed to run the application locally. Once installed, you can build, run, and test the API with ease.

**Installation Guide**: [Golang Installation](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### Install MinIO
MinIO acts as your local storage solution, replicating the AWS S3 environment where your application files will be uploaded and managed. Set up MinIO to ensure FaynoSync can interact with your local storage as it would with AWS S3.

**Installation Guide**: [MinIO Installation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/deploy-minio-single-node-single-drive.html)

After installing MinIO, open [http://localhost:9001/access-keys](http://localhost:9001/access-keys), create Access Keys, and set `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` in either .env or .env.local. To access the MinIO dashboard, use the `MINIO_ROOT_USER` specified in your MinIO configuration as the username and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` as the password.


### Running FaynoSync Locally

Once you have all these services set up, you can run FaynoSync locally, allowing you to develop and test your application seamlessly. This setup ensures that your local environment closely mirrors the production setup, making your development process efficient and straightforward.

To get started, you need to create an environment file (`.env`) and set all the required configurations. For more details on the necessary environment variables, please refer to the [Environment Configuration page](./env-overview).

#### Starting FaynoSync
To run FaynoSync, use the following command:
```bash
go run faynoSync.go
```
If this is your first time running FaynoSync, include the `--migration` flag to apply initial migrations:

```bash
go run faynoSync.go --migration
```

To roll back migrations, use:

```bash
go run faynoSync.go --migration --rollback
```

#### Testing Your Setup
You can verify that everything is set up correctly by running the test suite:

```bash
go test
```

This will ensure that all components are correctly configured and that your local development environment is ready for use.



## Setting Up Admin Dashboard

The FaynoSync Admin Dashboard provides a web interface for managing your FaynoSync API server. Here's how to set it up locally:

### Clone the Dashboard Repository

First, clone the admin dashboard repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ku9nov/faynoSync-dashboard.git
cd faynoSync-dashboard
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
VITE_PORT=3000
```

Make sure the `VITE_API_URL` points to your running FaynoSync API server (default port 9000).

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the Dashboard

Start the dashboard in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the dashboard on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### First-Time Setup

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Register a new account using your `API_KEY`
3. Once registered, you can start using the dashboard to manage your FaynoSync server

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for:
- Managing applications and versions
- Configuring channels and platforms
- Monitoring server health and statistics
- User and team management

If you encounter any issues during setup, feel free to consult the linked guides or reach out to our community on GitHub.
