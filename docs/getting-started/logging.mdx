# Logging Configuration

## Overview

The API server uses `logrus` for logging, providing a flexible way to manage log levels based on the current environment or specific needs. You can control the logging level by setting the `--loglevel` flag when running the application.

## Supported Log Levels

The following log levels are supported:

* debug – Detailed information, typically for diagnosing issues.
* info – General operational information about the application.
* warn – Potentially harmful situations, but the application is still running.
* error – Errors that prevent certain functionality but don't cause the system to stop.
* fatal – Critical errors that cause the application to terminate.
* panic – Logs panic messages before terminating.

## Command-Line Flag

The log level is specified using the `--loglevel` flag in the command line. By default, the log level is set to `info` if not provided.

**Syntax:**

```bash
--loglevel=<log_level>
```

## Example Log Levels
- **Development:** Use `debug` for detailed logs during development and testing.
- **Production**: Use `warn` or `error` in production to reduce log noise and focus on critical issues.
