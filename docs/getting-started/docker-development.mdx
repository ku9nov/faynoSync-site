# Docker Development

Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. This makes it easier to develop, ship, and run applications, as you can be confident that they will behave the same way in development, testing, and production.

For more information on Docker and to install it, visit the official [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To get started, you need to create an environment file (`.env`) and set all the required configurations. For more details on the necessary environment variables, please refer to the [Environment Configuration page](./env-overview).

## Building and Running the API

This step is primarily for users who want to explore the API without installing Golang locally. 

First, clone the FaynoSync repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ku9nov/faynoSync.git
cd faynoSync
```

Now you can build and run the FaynoSync API along with all its dependencies using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the necessary Docker images and start the containers as defined in `docker-compose.yaml` file.

:::tip Note

Rebuilding the Docker images each time can be time-consuming, making this approach less suitable for active development. It's recommended mainly for initial setup and testing the APIâ€™s functionality rather than for regular development tasks.

:::

## Running Tests

Once the services are running, you can execute the test suite with the following command (please wait until the `s3-service` successfully creates the bucket):

```bash
docker exec -it faynoSync_backend "/usr/bin/faynoSync_tests"
```

This command runs tests directly inside the `faynoSync_backend` container.

## Running Dependency Services for Local Development

If you prefer to work locally with **Golang** installed, you can start only the dependency services required for **FaynoSync** development by using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.development.yaml up
```

This setup will start essential services like **MongoDB** and **MinIO** without running the full API in a container.

:::tip Important
Make sure **Golang** is installed on your local machine. For instructions on setting up **Golang**, refer to the [Golang Installation Guide](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Setting Up Admin Dashboard

The FaynoSync Admin Dashboard provides a web interface for managing your FaynoSync API server. Here's how to set it up locally:

### Clone the Dashboard Repository

First, clone the admin dashboard repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ku9nov/faynoSync-dashboard.git
cd faynoSync-dashboard
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
VITE_PORT=3000
```

Make sure the `VITE_API_URL` points to your running FaynoSync API server (default port 9000).

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the Dashboard

Start the dashboard in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the dashboard on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### First-Time Setup

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Register a new account using your `API_KEY`
3. Once registered, you can start using the dashboard to manage your FaynoSync server

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for:
- Managing applications and versions
- Configuring channels and platforms
- Monitoring server health and statistics
- User and team management
